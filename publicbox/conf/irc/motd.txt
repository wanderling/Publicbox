Welcome to PublicBox IRC!

PublicBox creates offline wireless networks designed for anonymous file sharing, chatting, message boarding, and media streaming. You can think of it as a portable local internet server! 

PublicBox is designed to be safe and secure. No logins are required (except VOIP) and no user data is logged.

This version of PublicBox was ported by Daniel Roseman from the PirateBox project.

PirateBox was created by David Darts and the Lead Developer is Matthias Strubel. The project is licensed under the GPLv3. To learn more about the project or to find out how to build your own PirateBox, please visit http://piratebox.cc
